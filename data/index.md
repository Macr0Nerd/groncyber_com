howdy howdy, if you've found yourself here then you're either looking for information about gabe, in which case check
my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/gabe-ron), or you're here for whatever randomness i've come up with.

i'm a cybersecurity student and data engineer (really a secdevops engineer) with a wide gamut of interests. this website
is my space to do whatever weird and crazy stuff comes to mind, so if you stick around you might find something of
interest.

this website is built out of pure html and css, no dynamic shenanigans here. i'm not a terribly big fan of web
development so everything is automatically generated with markdown, python, and templates. as such, the only data that's
collected is whatever connection info is logged. there are a few things i wanna add so eventually a bit of the evil
language may be added, but so far there's none here. you can see my todo list here:
